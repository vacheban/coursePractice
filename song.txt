All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah, yeah

I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no breakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah,
I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today,
unstoppable today
Unstoppable today,
I'm unstoppable today
